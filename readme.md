# Anime Resort

This project was designed that I can get experienced with using Rest API's and JSON within PHP. The project itself is not hard to do and doesn't take a genius to do it but it was a good project to get me more knowledgeable on what I need to do to learn for the future.

Anime Resort is a website created with one goal in mind, to make it easier for people to find information about anime. Input a name for an anime and watch as all of the information related to it and the trailer shows before your eyes.

## Appendix

This is the start to a future project that I plan on creating soon. I plan on creating a full-scale anime website where people can register, select anime they are watching and much more. This is probably the base that I will use but I felt like open sourcing a simple version of it so that people can use it themselves if they want to.
